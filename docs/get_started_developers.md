# Get Started for Developers

The development of TensorBase is same to the idiom of Rust engineering.

0. It is assumed that you have setup your own Rust development environment.

    TIPS: You could have Rust toolchains and cargo installed into your path via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).
    
    NOTE: TensorBase is depending on the Rust nightly toolchain.

1. clone the project and go into that cloned repo directory

        git clone https://github.com/tensorbase/tensorbase.git
        cd tensorbase

2. config a base.conf for server booting

    Here is [an example of base.conf](/crates/server/tests/confs/base.conf). It is suggested that you just copy and change the meta_dirs and data_dirs to your own directory.

3. use cargo to run the server in debug mode (fast compilation but slow run),

        cargo run --bin server -- -c $path_to_base_conf$

    or in release mode (slow compilation but fast run),
        
        cargo run --release --bin server -- -c $path_to_base_conf$

    NOTE:
    + $path_to_base_conf$ is the full path of conf in #2.
    + current release profile is using lto = 'thin'. You could adjust the options in [Cargo.toml](Cargo.toml) for balancing the speed for compilation and running. However, TensorBase uses lto = 'fat' for its binary release.

4. ensure you have the binary of ClickHouse client

    + Download from the [ClickHouse release page](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/releases), stable release is recommended.
    + or [download here](https://github.com/tensorbase/tensorbase/releases/download/v2021.07.05/clickhouse_client_repack_linux.zip), a repacked ClickHouse client for your quick start.

5. connect to the TensorBase server with clickhouse-client like this:

        ```clickhouse-client --port 9528``` or ```clickhouse-client --port 9528 -n```
    
    NOTE:

    `--port` – Here 9528 is the default port of TensorBase.
    `--multiquery`, `-n` – If specified, allow processing multiple queries separated by semicolons. (So, it may be slightly quicker than multiple statements.)

6. execute query like this:

        ```sql
        create table employees (id UInt64, salary UInt64) ENGINE = BaseStorage;
        insert into employees values (0, 1000), (1, 1500);
        select count(id) from employees;
        select avg(salary) from employees;
        ```

7. more supported statements could be seen [here](/docs/lang.md).

    TensorBase supports high concurrent ingestions from clickhouse-client and native protocol drivers ( [Rust client driver here](/crates/tests_integ/ch_client)). Welcome to practice!

8. and TensorBase thanks for your contributions, read [Contributing](/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more.
