0. ensure you have the binary of ClickHouse client
    
    + Download from the [ClickHouse release page](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/releases), stable release is recommended.
    + or [download here](https://github.com/tensorbase/tensorbase/releases/download/v2021.07.05/clickhouse_client_repack_linux.zip), a repacked ClickHouse client for your quick start.

1. get the binary of TensorBase server
    
    Download from the [TensorBase release page](https://github.com/tensorbase/tensorbase/releases)

2. config a base.conf for server booting
    
    Here is [an example of base.conf](/crates/server/tests/confs/base.conf)

3. start the TensorBase server like this:

        ./server -c $path_to_base_conf$

4. connect to the TensorBase server with clickhouse-client like this:
        
        ```clickhouse-client --port 9528``` or ```clickhouse-client --port 9528 -n```
    
    NOTE:

    `--port` – Here 9528 is the default port of TensorBase.
    `--multiquery`, `-n` – If specified, allow processing multiple queries separated by semicolons. (So, it may be slightly quicker than multiple statements.)

5. execute query like this:

        ```sql
        create table employees (id UInt64, salary UInt64) ENGINE = BaseStorage;
        insert into employees values (0, 1000), (1, 1500);
        select count(id) from employees;
        select avg(salary) from employees;
        ```

6. more supported statements could be seen [here](/docs/lang.md)

    TensorBase supports high concurrent ingestions from clickhouse-client and native protocol drivers ( [Rust client driver here](/crates/tests_integ/ch_client)). Welcome to practice!
