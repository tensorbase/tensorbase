## What is TensorBase
TensorBase is a new big data warehousing with modern efforts.

TensorBase is building on top of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), [Apache Arrow](https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs) and [Arrow DataFusion](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion).

TensorBase hopes to change the status quo of bigdata system as follows:
  * low efficiency (in the name of 'scalable')
  * hard to use (for end users) and understand (for developers)
  * not evolving with modern infrastructures (OS, hardware, engineering...)

## :rocket: Quick News

* [SQL on RISC-V Chip in Rust](https://tensorbase.io/2021/06/08/sql_on_riscv_in_rust.html)

## Features

* Out-of-the-box to play ( [get started just now](#quick-start) )
* Lighting fast architectural performance in Rust ( [real-world benchmarks](#benchmarks) )
* Modern redesigned columnar storage 
* Top performance network transport server  
* ClickHouse compatible syntax
* Green installation with DBA-Free ops
* Reliability and high availability (WIP)
* Cluster (WIP)
* Cloud-Native Adaptation (WIP)
* Arrow dataLake (...)

* [Get Started for Users](/docs/get_started_users.md) 

* [Get Started for Developers](/docs/get_started_developers.md) 

## Benchmarks

TensorBase is **lighting fast**. TensorBase has shown better performance than that of ClickHouse in simple aggregation query on 1.47-billion rows NYC Taxi Dataset.

TensorBase has **enabled full workflow for TPC-H benchmarks from data ingestion to query**.

More detail about all benchmarks seen [in benchmarks](https://github.com/tensorbase/benchmarks).
